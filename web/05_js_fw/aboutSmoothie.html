    The 2017 Spring Season of the NA LCS started off hot for C9. The team was dominant 
    and in 1st place throughout most of the split. However their performance took a dip 
    later on and they finished 2nd with a 14-4 record right behind TSM. In the playoffs 
    it was a similar story as Cloud9 made it to the finals but lost 2-3 to Team SoloMid 
    in a very close series. In the Summer Season with increased competition, Cloud9 struggled 
    more than before and finished the regular split in 4th place. Their performance in 
    the playoffs was very lackluster and their run was cut short with a 1-3 loss to Team
    Dignitas in the Quarterfinals. Going into the Regional Qualifiers, the team managed 
    to qualify for the 2017 Season World Championship with a 3-1 win over CLG.

    At Worlds C9 finished first in their Play-In group with a 4-0 record and then defeated 
    Lyon Gaming 3-0 to advance to the Main Event. Put in Group A along with SK Telecom 
    T1, EDward Gaming and ahq e-Sports Club, C9 managed a 3-3 record and made it out of 
    the group in second place. Their Worlds run was put to a halt however after they lost
    2-3 to Team WE in a very close match.
