<h3>Jensen - Mid Lane</h3>

<p>
    Nicolaj "Jensen" Jensen, originally known as Veigodx, was a member of the founding 
    roster of Team Solo Mebdi, along with YamatoCannon, Nukeduck, Necaderp, and Rayt3rch.
    The team disbanded in January 2013 after being disqualified from the Season 3 EU LCS 
    qualifiers. On February 4th 2013, he was permanently banned from playing League of Legends 
    due to his "long history of DDOS activity, abusive behaviour and poor sportsmanship 
    across multiple accounts." Despite his permaban, Jensen continued playing on smurf 
    accounts and had several montages of his play released.

    On February 1st 2014, it was suggested that Incarnati0n had become the coach of SK Gaming, 
    and it was eventually confirmed.

<p>
    Incarnati0n was not allowed to attend the 2014 Season World Championship with SK Gaming 
    because while the LCS did not officially recognize coaches, Korea would for Worlds. 
    On September 17th it was announced that coaches would begin to be recognized officially in 
    the LCS, and the question arose whether Incarnati0n's lifetime ban would be lifted or not.
