<h3>Licorice - Top Lane</h3>

<p>
    Licorice spent some time on a few different teams in the Challenger Series 
    of North America. He was a substitute on Cloud9 Challenger for a while. He
    wouldn't find major success until he joined eUnited in December of 2016. The 
    team dominated the NA Challenger Series in 2016. In both the Spring Season and 
    Summer Season the team would finish in 1st place, barely dropping any matches. 
    However in each of their playoffs runs, they would finish second place after 1-3 
    losses to Gold Coin United. Although they had a chance to qualify for the LCS in 
    the 2017 Summer Promotion, they would lose 1-3 to Team EnVyUs and failed to do so. 
    Their second chance came in the 2018 Spring Promotion but they were again unable 
    to do so after an 0-3 loss to Phoenix1. In November of 2017 Licorice left eUnited 
    and joined Cloud9 as their new Top Laner.
