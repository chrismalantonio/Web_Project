    A native of Winter Springs, Florida, just north of Orlando, Sneaky played World 
    of WarCraft competitively achieving highest rated Mage Rogue in 2v2's sometime 
    in Season 6. He also played a lot of HoN, along with playing DOTA on the side. 
    Prior to LoL, He was studying Computer Science for a year at Florida Atlantic 
    University before entering the NA LCS.

    He began playing League of Legends back in Beta after he received a Beta invite. 
    However, his initial reaction was that the game sucked. This was because in his first 
    game he had no map at all and could only see the champions, towers, and minions. He
    didn't get into LoL until a few months later when he became bored of Heroes of Newearth. 
    Gangplank was his first played champion, but he believes  Veigar was his first main. 
    Sneaky's competitive LoL career was kicked started when he was first asked to join a 
    team with jpak after being noticed in Solo Queue. He joined Absolute Legends North America 
    along with jpak in hopes of gaining some competitive experience as well as having fun
    playing in tournaments. After the team broke up, he created a new team with Kenikth,
    Onionbagel, Kev√Æn, and Support Daddy under Pulse eSports. But after losing qualifiers 
    at MLG and IPL and several roster changes, he began to lose confidence in his teams
    ability to qualify for the summer promotion tournament. Sneaky joined Quantic Gaming 
    on April 6th, 2013 and proceeded to qualify for the 2013 NA LCS Summer Split and subsequently 
    joined Cloud 9 when C9 re-acquired the Quantic roster ahead of their LCS debut.
