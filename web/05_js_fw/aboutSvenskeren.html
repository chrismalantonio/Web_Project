<h3>Svenskeren - Jungle</h3>

<p>
    Svenskeren started his competitive League of Legends career with LoLLeague, before 
    joining 3DMAX towards the end of the season, where he played with puszu. Svenskeren 
    then left to join Leethuanyan's roster, which was picked up by Team Mistral soon after. 
    During his time with the team, Mistral played at Kings of Europe, and managed a 3rd place 
    finish, behind the powerhouses of Moscow Five and CLG Europe. Before the 3rd place match, 
    where Mistral went up against Team Sypher, Svenskeren was replaced by Kottenx, leaving him team-less.

    TSM's 2017 was domestically very successful. In the spring split despite looking 
    shaky at different stages of the regular split, TSM finished 1st with a 15-3 record. 
    In the playoffs TSM defeated Cloud9 3-2 in the finals in a very close series to capture 
    yet another LCS title. This also qualified them for the 2017 Mid-Season Invitational. 
    Despite fan expectations being decent, TSM failed to live up to expectations and finished 
    in 5th place with a 4-6 record. In the tiebreaker game against Flash Wolves the team lost 
    and were knocked out of MSI. In summer after Doublelift's return and WildTurtle's departure
    to FlyQuest, TSM was expected to dominate the split. They would finish 1st in the regular 
    season with 14 wins and 4 losses but were not back to their dominant selves. In the playoffs 
    they defeated Team Dignitas 3-1 in the semifinals and then took down Immortals 3-1 in the 
    finals to capture their third title in a row which was a first in NA LCS history. The win also
    qualified TSM for the 2017 Season World Championship.

    They were seeded in a group that looked weak on paper and consisted of a shaky Flash Wolves, 
    and untested Misfits and a questionable Team WE. TSM started off well with a 2 wins and 1 loss in 
    Week 1 but then in Week 2 they performed worse and went 1-2. Having to play a tiebreaker against 
    Misfits, TSM lost and were eliminated from Worlds in the group stage yet again in a fashion similar to 
    last years'. Svenskeren left TSM in November and joined Cloud9 in the same month.
