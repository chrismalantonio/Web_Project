                <p>
                    I had no real experience using HTML, CSS, javascript/jquery, or any client side frameworks before taking this class.

                    The advanced techniques that I used for this lab were rounded corners on the two images on 
                    the right and transparency on the image at the bottom of the page.

                    This lab taught me a lot of basics for CSS and HTML like syntax, classes, and ids. It also taught me what AngularJS does.

                <h3><a href="02_advLayout/index.html">Lab 2: Advanced Layout</a></h3>
                <p>
                    It was interesting learning about responsive design. I had no idea what jQuery was used for until this lab. 
                    Most of this lab was easy up until I had to put in the collapsible nav bar. 
                    It was tricky having to play around with the default mobile phone view vs desktop view for the nav bar. 
                    I think the most interesting things I learned in this lab were seeing 
                    jQuery and javascript in action and trying to understand what each line of code was doing for my page. 
                </p>
                <h3><a href="03_js_intro/index.html">Lab 3: JavaScript Intro</a></h3>
                <p>
                    Object oriented JavaScript was very easy considering I'm a senior now with a lot of java experience. 
                    The only part of this lab that I struggled with was trying to get the sorting function to work. I didn't think we had to modify the code originally, 
                    but I ended up modifying it and using getters to access the private properties of my object. After I figured that out, the rest was easy.
                    This lab taught me the basics of Object Oriented JavaScript.
