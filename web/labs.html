                <p>
                    I had no real experience using HTML, CSS, javascript/jquery, or any client side frameworks before taking this class.

                    The advanced techniques that I used for this lab were rounded corners on the two images on 
                    the right and transparency on the image at the bottom of the page.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This lab taught me a lot of basics for CSS and HTML like syntax, classes, and ids. It also taught me what AngularJS does.

                <h3><a href="02_advLayout/index.html">Lab 2: Advanced Layout</a></h3>
                <p>
                    It was interesting learning about responsive design. I had no idea what jQuery was used for until this lab. 
                    Most of this lab was easy up until I had to put in the collapsible nav bar. 
                    It was tricky having to play around with the default mobile phone view vs desktop view for the nav bar. 
                    I think the most interesting things I learned in this lab were seeing 
                    jQuery and javascript in action and trying to understand what each line of code was doing for my page. 
                </p>
                <h3><a href="03_js_intro/index.html">Lab 3: JavaScript Intro</a></h3>
                <p>
                    Object oriented JavaScript was very easy considering I'm a senior now with a lot of java experience. 
                    The only part of this lab that I struggled with was trying to get the sorting function to work. I didn't think we had to modify the code originally, 
                    but I ended up modifying it and using getters to access the private properties of my object. After I figured that out, the rest was easy.
                    This lab taught me the basics of Object Oriented JavaScript. 
                </p>
                <h3><a href="04_js_adv/index.html">Lab 4: Advanced JavaScript</a></h3>
                <p>
                    This lab was a lot more difficult than previous labs. I ran into quite a few problems that I had to address.
                    In the myStyle.css file I had set my img tag to 100% width, so I had to go into the showList function and edit 
                    the delIcon to be much smaller. After figuring that out the delete functionality was simple enough. 
                    The big problem for me was reading the cookies. I created a new object list that had public properties so that 
                    I could store the cookie, but when I went to read the cookie setting the private properties to equal the public properties didn't seem to work. 
                    I found out that the reason for this was that I was setting the private object list equal to the cookie object rather 
                    than setting the public object list equal to the cookie. 
                    This lab taught me how to delete objects from a list and about cookie persistence.

                <h3><a href="05_js_fw/index.html">JS Framework Mini Web Site</a></h3>  
                <p>
                    This week's lab was initially tricky to wrap my head around until I looked at the sample code and understood what 
                    we were supposed to do. The instructions were pretty clear. I didn't have any trouble with the HTML snippet aspect of the lab. 
                    The most difficult aspect of this lab was the part where we had to make a drop down bar without using jQuery. I couldn't get mine to 
                    work with JavaScript, so I just ended up using jQuery anyways.

                -->                <h3>Lab 6: Databases - MySQL Workbench</h3>
                <p>
                    This lab was a bit tedious because I had to manually enter 20+ records into my unique table. Other than that, it was pretty straightforward. 
                    In this lab I created two tables: an account table and a champion table. I learned how to insert, update, and delete records in these tables 
                    as well as the ability to search for specific records. I also learned how to use MySQL Workbench which is basically a GUI that makes MySQL more user friendly.

                <h3>Lab 7: Web API</h3>
                <p>
                    The main focus for this weeks lab was displaying data from a database onto the web. I made calls to my database in order to get the information I wanted in 
                    gson format and then converted it to JSON format so that I could manipulate the data and display it in a table. The hardest part for me was doing the jQuery 
                    version for inserting DOM elements. It took a little bit of googling to figure out the right functions to use, but overall this week's lab was OK. 
                    I learned a lot about working with information from databases and how to make my own API.
